# F4Hotels.com

## ABSTRACT

To keep up with the digital transformation, there is a need to create an online presence for hotels in the tourism and hospitality industry which helps the guests to always look for information and plan accordingly beforehand. The project “F4Hotels.com” is an end-2-end hotel booking application for a specific chain of hotels with locations all around the world. The purpose of this project is to develop and implement an online reservation system for hotels, that will replace the traditional way of booking hotel rooms. There are several downsides to the traditional way of booking hotel rooms like delay in processing the guests booking, no way to cross-verify the bookings, no rewards to take advantage of etc. which will be overcome with the online presence. 

This web-based application is designed to handle all the primary information required to display the list of hotels all around the world, rooms information, services and amenities, rewards program. This project intends to introduce more user friendliness in various activities such as manage your hotel rewards account, search for hotels, book one or more rooms, change/cancel reservations etc.

The primary goal of any website-based project is to establish an interactive user interface that is user (visitor) friendly, and we intend to meet that goal here in this project. This project is mainly based on HTML, CSS, ReactJS, JavaScript, JSON and SQL. It also makes use of basic php and jQuery plugins to make the website effective and efficient.
